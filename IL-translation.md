1-12 Translation
Goddess, tell me about Pelides' arrogant wrath,
which wrought sorrowful deaths on the wretched Greeks
and sent the brave souls of heroes down to Orcus:
the wrath that allowed dogs and birds to tear at
the heroes' bloodless limbs and unburied bones.
The highest king agreed that the conflict
had first been incited by the warring hearts
of sceptered Atrides and Achilles, renowned in battle.
Which god forced these men to struggle in such sorrowful wrath?
It was the child of Lato and powerful Jupiter. He sent
into the Pelasgian king's heart a horrible plague,
which likewise afflicted the Danaans.
