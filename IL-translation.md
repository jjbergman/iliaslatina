# Preface

@1   Goddess, tell me about the wrath of arrogant Pelides, which wrought sorrowful deaths on the wretched Greeks and sent the brave souls of heroes down to Orcus and left their bloodless limbs and unburied bones for dogs and birds to rip apart.
[superbus transferred? / brought about too weak? / why the reboot at line 4 and allowed? too free here?]

@6   The will of the highest king was abided, since first the warring hearts of sceptered Atrides and the renowned warrior Achilles created their feud.
[ut primum (unusually) = "since first"]

@9   Which god forced these men to struggle in such bitter anger?
[tristi not sorrowful here]

*10  It was the son of Lato[Leto] and powerful Jupiter.

*10  He infected the Pelasgian king's heart with a horrible plague and the Danaans were also embroiled in the grave illness.
[Try again on implicuit / sthg with gravi morbo?]

# [The priest's daughter?]
*13  One day, Chryses, wearing his sacred band wrapped around his head, wept, mourning the loss of his daughter, who had been taken from him. He spent hated days and nights and his constant lamentations filled the air.
["sacred band wrapped around his head" / wept and mourned paratactic? / he is not hateful, the passage of time is / this last bit is good, changing the subject away from an abl of means: but maybe not wailing?]

*17  Because not a single day lessened his grief, and his continual wailing could not allay his tears for his daughter, he sought the Danaan camp, prostrated himself at the feet of Atrides, and begged by the gods, in his misery, that the king's honor compel him to return his daughter, the source of his wellbeing.

22  He also offered gifts.

22  The Myrmidons were overcome by his tears and thought that Chryseis should be returned to her father.

24  But Atrides disagreed and forced Chryses to depart from his camp, rejecting his *pietas*: a fierce love clung in Atrides heart of hearts. His ruinous lust denied Chryses' prayers.

27 The slighted priest once again sought the temple of Phoebus; in his grief, he scratched his dirty face, tore out his hair, and beat his old temples.

30 When his groans subsided and his tears abated, he addressed the sacred ears of the prophetic god: how does it benefit me to have worshipped you, Delphic god, or to have led a chaste life for so many years?

34 Why did I place the sacred fires on your altar if I, your priest, am scorned by a foreign enemy?

36 See, these are the rewards I've been given in my old age.

37 If I have been an acceptable servant, keep me safe as my protector.

38 If otherwise, if I am paying the penalty for some harsh crime, of which I am ignorant, why does your hand refrain from further punishment?

40 Draw your sacred bow and take aim.

41 At least a god will be behind my demise.

41 Attack the father, the one who deserves punishment.

42 Why is my daughter paying for my transgressions? Why is she forced to endure a life in my cruel enemy's bed?

44 He pled his case.

44 Moved by his priest's plea, Apollo wrought great sorrow on the Danaans by sending a plague that infected every soldier.

46 The Greeks fell to ruin. There was hardly enough land for all the funeral pyres and tombs, and hardly enough air for the fires.

48 After the stars had been seen for the ninth night and the sun shone on the tenth day, illustrious Achilles assembled the Greek chiefs and encouraged Thestorides to reveal the causes of the evil plague.

52 Then Calchas consulted the gods and found the cause of their misfortune as well as the way to end it. He feared the crowd, but with Achilles' protection he said this: "Danaans, if we wish to find refuge from this pestilence, we must placate the will of wrathful Phoebus and return chaste Chryseis to her righteous father."

58 He finished speaking.

58 Suddenly, the king became enraged.

59 He hurled bitter insults at Thestorides and called him a liar.

60 Then he rebuked great Achilles, but the unconquerable hero returned his insults.

62 All the others present join the fracas.

62 When the shouting finally subsided, the unjust son of Atreus was forced to return his unwilling bride and give Chryseis, untouched, back to her dutiful father, along with many other reparations.

65 Ulysses, trusted by all, placed her on his ship and brought her back to her father's care. Then, he again set sail to return to the Danaan fleet.

68 Immediately Phoebus abandoned his grudge.

69 The Greek host, which had nearly been destroyed, blossomed once again.

70 However, Atrides' desire for Chryseis did not fade; he mourned and grieved for his lost love, feeling that he had been cheated.

72 Then, he snatched Briseis from great Achilles and lightened the burden of his love by depriving another of his beloved.

74 But savage Aeacides approached Atrides with his sword drawn and threatened that, if he did not return his prize, which he had fairly won, he would give Atrides a bloody death. Each man prepared himself for a duel.

78 If chaste Pallas had not forced Achilles to withdraw, blind love would have left her cruel mark in the annals of Argive history.

80 Because his threats were ignored, Pelides prayed that his mother, a goddess of the sea, would not allow Plisthenides to go unpunished.

83 Thetis heard her son's prayer and immediately left the sea. She came to the Myrmidon camp and warned him to refrain from any fights or contests; afterwards, she flew through heaven and carried herself into the golden stars.

87 Then, with her hair still unkempt, she laid herself at the feet of the king of heaven: "I come to you as a mother on behalf of her son, begging your divine power, highest father.

89 Avenge me and my son for Atrides' wrongdoing; if you allow him to go unpunished for violating the love of my Achilles, all virtue will die a shameful death, conquered by lust."

93 Jupiter responded: "Cast aside your sorrowful lament, goddess of the great sea, for I will fulfill your undertaking.

95 Console your son's grieving heart."

96 He finished.

96 Thetis glided down through the gentle air of heaven and came @to her father's shores and sisters' beloved waves.

98 However, Juno was offended: "Great husband of mine," she said, "does the daughter of Doris hold so much sway, is so much owed to Achilles? @But as for me, whom you call your wife and sweet sister, you wish to shed the blood of my beloved Argives and renew the fighting spirit of the Trojans?"

103 Are these your gifts for me?

103 Is this how much you love me?

104 The angered goddess hurled harsh words at the Thundering god, but in turn she endured the reproach of the king of heaven.

106 Finally, after the god of fire stepped in to settle the dispute, the great father dismissed the council from his hall.

108 Meanwhile, the sun descended from Olympus and the gods and goddesses held a lavish feast to reinvigorate themselves.

110 Then, they headed  their bedrooms and the delightful gift of sleep.

# Somnus's Mission

111 As night fell, the stars were shining throughout the sky as humans and gods alike rested. The omnipotent father called Somnus and said this: "Go, fly through the light winds, gentlest of the gods, and seek the Argive leader's camp on swift wings. And while he is overwhelmed by the weight of your sweet sleep, relay these orders to him: "when tomorrow's day has first brought out the Titan and chased away the night, gather your men for battle and attack the unwary enemy." (Do I need to preserve the indirect command or is imperative okay)

120 Without delay, Somnus departed and flew through the air on his slender wings into Agamemnon's bed.

121 Somnus laid next to him and held his body, which was overwhelmed by gentle sleep.

123 The lightener of worry and burdens said this to him: "king of the Danaans, Son of Atreus, awaken and receive the instructions of the Thundering god, which I bring to you from heaven."

126 When first the Titan emerges from the waves, order your allies to affix their weapons to their strong arms and seek the Ilian fields in rank and file."

129 He uttered these commands and went back through the breezes whence he had just come.

130 Meanwhile, the sky's fiery lantern gave light to the world.

131 Still astonished by these visions, the Pelopeian hero called an assembly of his generals and explained in order the events of his dream.

133 Everyone pledged their allied forces in battle and encouraged their leader.

134 The king praised their brave hearts and gave equal thanks to all of them.

136 Then Thersites, than whom no one uglier had come to Troy, nor any with a more reckless tongue, (could make this more idiomatic, say something like the ugliest man who came to Troy and the most reckless speaker) denied that this war should be continued and encouraged a return to their native shores. Ulysses, of illustrious counsel, chastised him and struck him with his ivory scepter.

141 Then he became truly angry at the proposed alternative.

142 Scarcely did a hand lack a spear as their tumult is lifted to the stars and the intensity of the fight gripped them all.

144 Finally Nestor, wise in his old age, spoke his placid counsel to settle the disturbed crowd. He advised the leaders to recall the response of the oracle when they saw a serpent in a tree in Aulis consume twice four baby birds along with their mother, who weakly tried to defend against it, but became the final corpse after her children. (probably too free)

151 Then the old man said this: "I am warning you and remind you, Achaeans: it was Calchas who said that in the tenth year of our labor, Ilion would fall to the conquering Greek armies."

154 All agree. Nestor's wisdom is praised and the council is dismissed.

155 The leader orders his men to prepare their weapons for battle, along with their minds and bodies.

157 When first light dispelled the silent shadows and Titan raised his head from the waves, showing his shining rays, the harsh son of Atreus ordered his allies to arm themselves and seek the Ilian fields in military order.

# Invocation of the Muses

161 Now Muses - for what is unknown to you? - tell me the names of the famous leaders, their famous lineage and sweet homeland, because these are your gifts.

164 Let us relate how many ships each man led to Pergamum and finish this undertaking. May Apollo be our inspiration and freely aid our work in each line.

# The Catalog of Ships

167 First came (or is this the noun as appositive) Peneleus and the keen warrior Leitus, savage Arcesilaus and Prothoenor and Clonius, the Boeotians, who led fifty ships and coursed through the swelling tides using their strong oarsmen.

171 Then Agamemnon, born of Mycenae's walls, whom warlike Greece chose as their leader, led a hundred ships filled with armed soldiers; and the fiery Menelaus followed with sixty ships, as did Agapenor in his wild rage.

176 Near these men was faithful Nestor, a man of wise sentiment and powerful counsel, along with his twin sons, who brought ninety ships armed for war.

179 Schedius, a man of great virtue, and massive Epistrophus, the glory of the Myrmidons, both bulwarks in the savage war, plowed the tall waves along with forty prows, and Polypoetes and Leonteus led forty ships carrying brave soldiers.

184 The leaders Euryalus and Sthenelus, along with the brave soldier Tydides, cut through the sea with their strong oars; these men loaded eighty ships with soldiers.

187 Powerful Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, both keen men, filled thirty ships with strong oarsmen, and Ajax, the bravest of the Locrians, led twice twenty ships, as did the son of Euhaemon. They were accompanied by Achilles, the wall of the Greeks, sailing fifty ships across his mother's seas.

193 Phidippus and Antiphus, the Thessalonian youth came next, leading thrice ten prows cleaving the deep sea.

195 And Teucer cut through the waves with his three ships, while Tlepolemus the Rhodian took nine. Eumelus, a man of keen strength, followed these men, having set sail with one fewer ship than that of Salaminian Ajax, the son of Telamon.

199 And Prothous the Magnesian, son of Tenthredon, and also Elephenor, born in the great land of Euboea, and Meges the Dulichian, and Thoas, a man of great courage and strength, the son of Andraemon of the Aetolians, altogether led forty ships.

204 And the wise man of Ithaca, Ulysses, led twice six ships, followed by Telamonian Ajax, a man of exceptional courage.

206 With him came Guneus, a man of frightening strength, sailing twice eleven ships.

208 Idomeneus and Meriones, both of Crete, came also, strengthened by forty ships; and Menestheus the Athenian, a man of famed heritage, led as many ships as Achilles could muster.

212 Fierce Amphimachus and Thalpius, born in Elis, and Polyxenus, a man of famed courage, along with Diores, altogether loaded twice twenty ships with soldiers.

215 Protesilaus and brave Podarces drove as many ships as Oileus Ajax led, all fitted for battle; and the son of Poeas brought seven armed ships. Near him followed Podalirius and Machaon, who cut through the wide sea with thrice ten prows.

220 With all these men leading them, the Greeks led fourteen fewer than twelve hundred ships to the shores of Troy.

222 The men quickly put the ships ashore and took to the field when the Saturnian father sent Priam a message from Iris to warn him that the brave Pelasgians had come to wage war.

225 Without delay, Hector Priamides immediately took up arms, as was his father's command, and ordered all the Trojan youth to ready themselves for battle so he could lead them through the city's open gates.

228 A shiny golden helmet covered each side of his youthful head, a breastplate protected his chest and a shield adorned his left side. He wielded a spear in his right hand and a sword hung at his side; also, shining greaves, befitting of Hector, covered his long legs.

233 A more beautiful man followed after him, who was at that time mighty in arms: the cause of the war, Paris, the calamitous ruin of his homeland. Deiphobus and Helenus and brave Polites followed as well, along with sacred Aeneas, most certainly the child of Venus, and Archelochus and savage Acamas, the sons of Antenor; indeed, both Pandarus, the noble descendant of Lycaon, and Glaucus, a man of great courage in battle, came to fight, as did Amphius and Adrastus and Asius and Pylaeus.

240 Amphimachus and Nastes, each great men, also came, with the brave leaders Odius and massive Epistrophus, as did savage Euphemus and Pyraechmes, famous in his time, with whom came Mesthles and Antiphus and the great fighter Hippothous and Acamas and Pirous, together with Chromius and Ennomus, the sons of Arsinous, both of them in their prime, followed by Phorcus and great Ascanius, and also Sarpedon, the renowned offspring of Jupiter, and Coroebus, born in that famed land.

250 Neptunian Troy defended herself with the help of these leaders, and would have foiled the plot of the Greeks, if not for the fates.

# Hector Proposes a Duel

252 And now both battle lines were standing in their resplendent armor, when Paris, the deadly flame and destruction of Troy, saw a fully-armed Menelaus standing in the opposing army. Paris runs back frantically to his allies as if he had seen a snake and was terrified.

256 Hector saw him in his shameless disarray and said: "You, our country's eternal disgrace and our family's dishonor, why are you turning your back on this?"

259 Once, you did not hesitate to violate the bed of a host, whose weapons you are fleeing and force you fear.

261 Where is your courage? Where is your strength that we once knew in different competitions and games?

263 Here is where you show us your character.

263 Your famous beauty will not help you in battle.

264 Mars likes a tough soldier.

265 While you sleep with your love, we must wage war and shed our blood in our enemy's midst.

267 Let unwearied Atrides fight you and match your strength on an equal field as the Danaans and Phrygians watch without any fighting.

269 After a treaty is agreed upon, you must bring your force to bear against him and settle the dispute by the sword."

271 He finished speaking.

271 The Priamian hero said a few words in return: "why do you insult me so undeservingly, brother, pride of my country?"

273 It is untrue that my spouse, my stolen luxury, is greater than the honor of my courage. I do not refuse to test my strength in battle against his, as long as my wife goes to the victor without further bloodshed."

277 Hector reported this conversation; the Greeks agreed with the plan.

# The Duel of Paris and Menelaus

278 Immediately, Priam was summoned to carry out the proper sacrifices and seal the treaties.

279 After that, each group departed, cast aside their weapons, and cleared the field.

281 Meanwhile, beautiful Alexander appeared from the Trojan crowd, easily spotted because of his shield and spear.

283 Menelaus stood against him, gleaming in his armor, and said "Let us begin our fight. You will no longer enjoy the company of my wife, and you will mourn the day you took her, as Jupiter is my witness."

287 As soon as he had finished speaking, the bitter man rushed against his enemy.

288 Paris repelled his approach with a strong blow and took a few quick step in retreat. He then threw a quivering spear from afar, but Atrides avoided it. In turn, he threw a spear which would have pierced the Phrygian thief's body, if not for the seven-fold iron mail which covered his brood chest in the back.

294 There was an outcry all around; then each man stood against the other, as their helmets crashed together, their feet kicked at the other's heels, and their swords whistled and vibrated; both men were protected by their brilliant weapons and armor.

298 They were not unlike strong bulls, who wage war over a pretty mate and, as they fight, their loud mooing fills the air.

300 For a long time they used their rough swords to try to cut the other man. But, when Atrides remembered his stolen bride, he closed in and overwhelmed the Dardanian youth.

302 Paris retreated backwards as Menelaus threatened him from above with his swordplay. However, his splendid sword shattered when he struck the edge of Paris's helmet. The Greeks groaned in dismay.

306 Then Menelaus truly flew into a rage, though his hand lacked a sword, and he knocked the young Paris over and dragged his helmet to his allies, @holding it as if he had won. If Cytherea had not covered Paris in a dark mist and @broken the strong strap on his chin, that would have been Paris's last day.

311 Menelaus dragged the shining golden helmet and angrily threw it to the chiefs. He then again returned to the fight and threw a huge spear with all his strength to finish off the Phrygian, but Venus snatched Paris away from his enemy and brought him into his bed, inlaid with tortoise shell.

# Paris and Helen commiserate

317 Then she summoned Helen from the tall walls and led her to her love, Dardanian Paris.

319 When Helen saw him, she said: "Paris, my love, have you come to me a loser in the fight against my former spouse?"

321 I saw it happen and was ashamed to see when violent Atrides took hold of you and dragged you around and soiled your hair in the Ilian dust.

324 Miserable me! I feared that his Doric sword would bring an end to our kisses; my mind was driven insane, all color fled from my face and my blood left my limbs.

327 Who persuaded you to go up against savage Atrides?

328 Or had the widespread fame of his courage in battle not yet reached your ears?

329 I am telling you, you should not wish to entrust your fate to his hand. @(What to do with inique)

331 She said this as large tears flooded her face.

332 Gloomy Alexander replied: "Atrides did not defeat me, O my love, but rather the wrath of chaste Pallas."

334 Soon you will see, he will shamefully succumb to my strength, and Cytherea will aid me in this endeavor.

336 After that, they mutually embraced and he lay with her, the child of the swan; she received his love and that of Troy @(Troiae) with an open bosom

# The fighting resumes

339 Meanwhile, Menelaus looked for Alexander among the Trojans and carried himself as if he had won.

341 His brother helps him while rousing the allied troops for war. He yelled harsh words at the beaten Phrygians, claiming that the conditions of the battle should be observed and Helen should be returned.

344 While the leaders continued to argue amongst themselves, the omnipotent king of Olympus held a council meeting. Then, Pandarus drew his bow and ended the truce, seeking you, Menelaus; the flying arrow cut into his side and cut his reinforced iron tunic.

349 Atrides let out a groan and left the field to go to the safety of the camp. There, the young Podalirius, using the knowledge handed down from his father, healed Menelaus with Paeonian herbs and sent him back to the horrifying and bloody battle.

353 Agamemnon's wrath roused his brave troops for battle as their communal grief compelled them to fight.

355 A great battle arose and much blood was shed on both sides. Bodies were scattered across the whole field as throngs of Trojans and Greeks were killed in turn. There was no rest for the men: Mars' cries could be heard everywhere as showers of spears flew in all directions.

360 Thalysiades was cut down by the harsh sword of Antilochus and plunged into the realm of shadows, leaving the pleasing world of light.

362 Then Telamonian Ajax attacked Anthemion's son, who was pursuing the Greeks from behind with all his strength, and pierced his chest using his hardened spear.

365 The son of Anthemion vomited purple guts mixed with blood and began to cry as he passed away. @(Should this be riget? Like hardened? Or is he crying?)

366 Then Antiphus exerted all the force of his body to hurl a spear at Aeacides; however, the spear wandered from its intended enemy and struck a different one, piercing Leucon's groin.

370 This unlucky man was laid low by the grievous wound and, while he lay dying, he chewed on the green grass.

372 Unwearied Atrides was moved by his friend's death. He attacked Democoon and pierced his temples with his wooden spear. The wild son of Atreus drew his sword from its sheath. Democoon fell to his attacks and as he lay dying on his back, he beat his head against the ground.

377 Then Pirous, the son of Imbrasus, threw a huge rock at Amaryncides, which knocked him down and handed him over to silent death; but while he eagerly tried to plunder the young man's spoils, a spear came from above that was sent by the hand of Thoas. The spear pierced Pirous' shoulders and went straight through his strong chest.

382 He fell on his face as he vomited warm blood and trembled while he lay on top of his weapons.

384 Everywhere the Dardanian fields were wet with blood. The rivers ran red with blood likewise.

385 Both armies raged as they fought in the turmoil. First the courage of the Trojans, then that of the Greeks became greater, as both sides desired sweet victory through any means necessary.

# The aristeia of Diomedes

389 Then, after Tydides saw from afar that the Greek troops were wavering and Mars was growing in strength, he rushed into the middle of the fighting, where the greater part of the enemy were, and he cut down their muddled ranks in a massacre.

393 He savagely brandished his sword and spear in all directions.

394 Warlike Pallas, who was nearby, aided his ardent attacks with a fiery passion. She granted the young man both courage and strength.

396 As a savage lioness is driven by hunger when she sees a herd of cattle, and charges into the herd to tear at their exposed bodies, so did the Calydonian hero charge into the enemy lines. The warlike virgin goddess used her divine power to keep him safe, warning him when danger arose.

401 As the Phrygians turned back and fled, Tydides pursued the retreating troops and trampled the piled masses of his expiring foes.

403 While he wrathfully struck down his enemy, in his rage he saw the sons of Dares, Phegeus and also Idaeus, standing among his adversaries. Phegeus attacked him first with his weighted spear, but Tydides’ shield repelled the blow and the spear, having missed its mark, stuck into the ground.

407 Without delay, Tydides hurled a massive javelin with all his strength and pierced Phegeus’ chest: the spear ran through his whole body, sticking through his chest and his shoulders.

411 When Phegeus’s brother saw him spouting a river of warm blood and rolling his eyes and breathing his last, he drew his sword and swiftly flew to defend his brother’s fate.

415 But, Idaeus was not able to endure the force nor the mighty attacks of savage Tydides, @and yet he tried to defend himself. (what to do with tamen)

417 As when a bird sees a hawk tearing and mutilating her child’s body, but is unable to strike back, and in her distress is not strong enough to aid or save her offspring, so she beats her breast with her weak wings, Idaeus looked on as his enemy grew arrogant because of his brother’s death. He was unable to run to the aid of his brother, and if he had not yielded, he would have been killed by the same hand.

# The battle rages on

424 The other son of Atreus attacked the Teucri with no less fury as he pursued the Trojan lines and sent many men to their grave by his sword.

426 Unlucky Odius, led by unkind fate, came to attack him, but Atrides hurled a spear which struck him and pierced through his shoulders.

429 Idomeneus then attacked Phaestus the Maeonian, who was running to attack him from the enemy lines. After Idomeneus happily killed him, he sent Strophius' son down to the Stygian realm as well.

432 Meriones hurled a spear which struck down Phereclus, as Meges did to Pedaeus.

433 Then, looking terrifying in his armor, Eurypylus cut down Hypsenor as he attacked, and he stripped the young man of his life and his equipment alike.

# Diomedes takes on Pandarus and Aeneas

436 Pandarus came forth from another part of the field with his bow already drawn. He looked for Tydides among the vast armies; Pandarus saw him cutting down the bodies of Trojan soldiers and he aimed a deadly arrow from his taut bow which grazed the top of Tydides' shoulder.

441 Then the Calydonian youth became truly enraged and carried himself into the middle of the fighting, like a savage lion, as he cut down Astynous and also great Hypiron- the first he killed in hand to hand swordfighting and the second with his javelin from afar.

445 Then he attacked Polyidon and Abas using his spear, as well as Xanthus, who was famous in battle, and Thoon, who was an immense man.

447 After cutting down these men, the enraged son of Tydeus attacked Chromius and Echemmon with his swift spearwork and sent them to Tartarus as well.

449 You also, Pandarus, were laid low by the hand of Tydides and received a gruesome wound that joined the right side of your nose to your brow.

452 His brains seeped out, since they had been torn out with part of his helmet, as Tydides cut and stabbed his bones as well.

454 And now Aeneas and the Calydonian hero pitted their force against each other by throwing spears at each other from close by.

456 While they both attempted to seek an opening to strike with their swords, they would retreat backwards and then attack once more.

458 After each man had stood tall for a long time, and great Tydides could not see how he could injure Aeneas with his attacks, Tydides lifted a massive rock, which was sitting by chance in the middle of the field and would have taken twelve young men to barely lift from the ground, and threw it with all his strength at Aeneas.

463 He fell to the ground in his full armor, then Venus, his mother, glided down through the heavenly air and took him from the field, covering his body with a dark fog.

466 Oenides could not bear this, so he went through the mist and ardently attacked Venus. In his demented state he could not see an opportunity to strike Aeneas, but he saw Venus's heavenly hand and wounded it with his merely human spear.

470 Cytherea was wounded, so she abandoned the earth and returned to heaven, where she complained about her injury to her heavenly mother.

472 Trojan Apollo saved Dardanian Aeneas, then roused his courage and sent him back again to fight.

474 Everywhere the battle lines fought on, as the air became thick with dust and grew loud from the horrible cries of the soldiers.

476 Then, one man was knocked to the ground and trampled by a swift chariot and the hooves of horses. Another was pierced by a flying spear and fell off his horse. @(What to do with tergo)

479 His head was chopped off and rolled away from his neck; his brains seeped from his head as he lay dead on top of his weapons.

482 The ground ran red with blood and the fields became wet from all the sweat.

483 Meanwhile, the handsome son of Venus leapt forth and attacked the crowded Greek troops. He mowed and cut down their exposed flank across the whole line and created more deadly duels.

# The battle continues

486 Hector, the bravest of the Phrygians and their one hope, did not hold back from slaughtering and turning back the Greek troops.

488 Like a wolf when it sees sheep in an open field, and neither the shepherd nor his dogs frighten him, so he growls hungrily, ignores all else, and rushes eagerly into the middle of the herd, no differently @(how to finish this metaphor, haud secus) did Hector attack the Danaans and terrify them by waving his bloody sword.

493 The Greek lines faltered as the Phyrgians fiercely press on with increased courage.

494 Victory doubles their efforts.

495 When he saw his allies losing the deadly battle, the exalted king of the Danaans flew on horseback into the thicket, encouraging his leaders and reaffirming their courage in the battle.

498 Soon he boldly carried himself into the middle of the enemy with his sword drawn and split the opposing lines.

500 Like an African lion, which rejoices @(know its joyous herds but this makes more sense to me as transferred) when it sees a far off herd of cows that are grazing on the green grass, then raises his mane and puffs his chest and, because he is thirsting for their blood, runs into the middle of the flock, the savage son of Atreus went into the enemy lines and repulsed the hostile Phrygian troops with his spear.

506 Their leader's visible example of courage raised the spirits of the Greeks and inspired the soldiers' tiring arms.

508 The Teucri were routed and the Danaans rejoiced.

509 Finally Atrides saw Aeneas heading toward him on his chariot.

510 He drew his sword and prepared to run at him. He hurled a spear with as much strength as rage can give, but it missed his chest and instead pierced deep into the chariot driver's stomach.

514 He fell down from the force of the blow with the reins, which caused him to turn the wheel as warm blood poured from him.

516 Bold Aeneas cried out in anguish and jumped off the tall chariot. He struck and killed Crethon and Orsilochus in hand to hand combat. After their deaths, Menelaus conquered the leader of the Paphlagonians, and Antilochus killed Mydon.

520 After that, Jupiter's famous son Sarpedon joined the battle, bringing his deadly force with him.

522 Unlucky Tlepolemus, the son of great Hercules, fought him in with unequal arms, and neither his father's strength nor his many labors were able to save him. He fell, and surrendered his weak spirit from his body.

526 Sarpedon had been wounded, so he retreated from the heat of battle. Ulysses, the wily trickster, replaced him and killed seven of the bravest young men of Troy.

529 On one side fought the great warrior Hector, the best of his country, and on the other fought Tydides.

530 On both sides there are bodies scattered throughout the fields and the meadows were wet with blood.

532 Mars the powerful fought against chaste Pallas. He moved his great shield in defense, but the sacred virgin pushed it aside and cut him with the very tip of her spear. She compelled Mars, who was stupefied at his loss, to return to heaven at once.

536 There, he complained about his wounds to the divine king and endured the abuse of the almighty father.

538 Meanwhile, Ajax put an end to Acamantes, despite his great strength. Menelaus captured monstrous Adrastus, tied his hands behind his back, and took him back to the fleet as a splendid trophy, since Menelaus had taken him from the enemy by force.

542 The Danaans pressed on as the Trojan youth retreated and tried to cover their rear.

# Hector appeases Pallas Athena while Glaucus and Diomedes converse

543 Mars-like Hector realized that the gods were fighting for the Greeks and the Trojan forces were being subdued by the will of the warlike virgin goddess. Hector returned at once to the walls and ordered that Hecuba be called to placate the divine will of the goddess. @(not exactly the translation but makes more sense story wise)

548 Immediately the Trojans ascended to the unwed goddess's fortified citadel.

549 They placed sacred wreaths on her altar and, as is customary, sacrificed the consecrated animals.

551 @(Need to work on whole sentence. Who is the one trying to throw a spear?) While Hecuba prayed as a suppliant at Minerva's temple, on behalf of her dear children and spouse, Glaucus drew his sword and prepared to fight Diomedes. Diomedes asked for his name and family, who he is and where he came from. As fierce Glaucus was preparing to throw a spear with all his strength, the Aetolian hero cried out to him: "Why are you rushing to me? What reason compels you, accursed man, to come so furiously against me, despite your unequal strength?"

559 You see before you the arms of a visitor to your land, who wounded Venus's hand and injured Mars in our last duel.

561 Restrain your fierce pride and lay down your hostile weapons."

562 After these words were said, they both did not wish to fight. They exchanged shields and left behind any animosity.

564 Meanwhile, Andromache, the faithful wife of Hector, wanted to speak with him as she held her little son Astynax on her chest. While the great hero asked for his little kisses, the child seemed terrified and turned his shy face back to his mother's breast because he was hiding from Hector's frightening helm and flowing crest.

570 When Hector took the bronze off, uncovering his head, immediately he hugged the child in both his arms and raised his hands, saying: "I pray, O great father, that my son, for whom I worship your holiness, will follow the example of his father's courage from his early years and for the rest of his life."

# Hector and Ajax duel

575 The fierce warrior said these things and went through the open gates and out to battle along with Paris.

576 When he came into battle, immediately great Hector proceeded into the middle of the fray and challenged the Greek leaders, because he had unconquerable strength.

579 Without delay, wily Ulysses the deceiver, and fierce Idomeneus and Meriones, famous because of his father's lineage, and the savage son of Atreus, who was the leader of the Greeks, and the two Ajaxes, and beautiful Eurypylus in his famous arms, and Thoas, son of great Andraemon, and he who humiliated Venus by inflicting her hand with a wound, all stepped forth; but Achilles, the terror of the Trojans, was absent as he played the sweet lyre to assuage the harsh loss of his beloved.

587 Their lots were cast into king Atrides' gilded helmet and great Ajax was chosen. Ajax and Hector began their fight by throwing spears at each other.

590 Then they drew their stiff swords and settled the dispute with their fierce strength. They each looked for openings and tried to attack the other's back, but they each repelled the strong attacks with their mighty shields.

593 They shouted to the heavens and filled the air with their cries.

594 Not even boars can stimulate their anger with such passion and roar from their great chests, then attack the strong backside of their enemy with their tusks and foam at the mouth once more, compared to Hector and Ajax as they successively swung their swords and wounded the other. @ (work on this whole sentence, how to construe metaphor)

599 There appeared smoky clouds of dust, great flashes of light, and flames; the woods become loud from the noise.

601 The son of Priam and fiery Ajax fought with strength of that kind.

602 Finally, Telamonian Ajax's spear and courage went into a fury as he took aim at the great warrior Hector. He saw that Hector's neck lay exposed and aimed his gleaming sword there.

605 Clever Hector saw the attack coming, protected his exposed side, and blocked Ajax's sword with his shield.

607 But his nimble sword glanced off the top of the shield grazed his neck, slightly wounding him.

609 The son of Priam began to fight more fiercely, again rising against his enemy. However, this time he attacked the son of Telamon not with his sword, but by throwing a massive rock.

611 But fierce Ajax repelled the strong blow with his seven-layered shield and struck down the young warrior with the same rock.

614 Apollo, who was hostile to the Greeks, removed him from the battle and renewed his strength; then, they again returned to the fight and drew their swords, when weary Titan began to drive his fiery chariot into the sea. Night began to take over the sky.

618 Men are sent to pull both of the fighters apart from their duel. They both quickly lay aside their animosity.

620 Then Hector, the greatest warrior, said "which land, which parents gave birth to you? You are the noble and glorious offspring of a great people."

623 In return, Telamonian Ajax was prepared to say: "You see before you the son of Telamon and my mother Hesiona; my house is a noble one and my family is famous for its stock."

626 As Hector recalled Hesiona's name and deeds, he said: "let us end our fight, since we share common blood," and he first gives Aeacides a golden sword. In return, Hector received the engraved belt that the warrior Ajax was wearing.

631 After that, the Greek and Trojan crowds immediately departed as dark night covered the sky in darkness.

633 They threw a lavish banquet and drank the liquor of Bacchus to their satisfaction. They then eagerly surrendered themselves to sweet sleep.

# The Trojans propose a truce

635 Afterwards, when Aurora had first chased away the stars, the Phrygians held a meeting.

636 Then great Hector, remembering how many of his friends had died the day before, urged that Helen be returned to the unconquerable Greeks along with gifts that might appease Menelaus's harsh rage; everyone agrees.

640 Then, Idaeus, the messenger of the Trojans, brought the terms to the savage son of Atreus; but he did not agree to the gifts and would not listen to his words; he ordered Idaeus to depart from his camp.

644 He obeyed and returned to the Trojan camp, since he had been scorned by the harsh enemy. @(Can't remember what troica is)

646 Meanwhile, the Danaans mourned their dead and built massive pyres. They placed all of the strong bodies of their fallen allies on the flames.

649 Then they rebuilt the trenches and reinforced the oak wall.

# Jupiter weighs the fates

650 As Titan's shining rays first brought light to the world, Jupiter called a council of the gods and warned them all not to go against his command that they not fight.

653 He himself then glided down through the heavenly air and sat down on shadowy Mt. Ida.

655 Then, he looked at the Trojan lines and held the golden scales, currently of equal weight, in his powerful right hand. He weighed the harsh fate of the Phrygians and the misfortunes of the Achaeans and found that the Greek calamities while waging grave war outweighed that of the Trojans. @ (still praeponderat gives me trouble. NOt sure exactly what this sentence says.)

# The Trojans attack the Greek camp

659 Meanwhile, Priamides was riled up and attacked the Danaans in all his fury. He heavily oppressed them with all his strength, by all means the lone glory of the Phrygian people.

661 The Achaeans were thrown into turmoil and the Greek camp was filled by the commotion.

663 Atrides was also enclosed within the walls and encouraged his allies to harden their wilting resolve in battle.

665 Tydides first burst forth with fiery arms and went like a great whirlwind into the middle of the enemy.

667 Ill-fated Agelaus ran to meet him, brandishing a huge spear, but the great hero attacked him and thrust his sword through his stomach.

670 Then, Teucer was able to drive the Phrygians back, since he was defended by Ajax's mighty arms. He swiftly scattered arrows on the Trojan rear.

672 He vitally wounded fierce Gorgythion as well.

673 Then, he went to the other parts of the battle and killed proud Hector's charioteer, but the Trojan hero grabbed a rock and crushed him, since he was unprotected after he put down his bow. @(Not sure if Hector lets loose a bow or this is what it means. Excusso arcu is the issue)

676 His faithful comrades take him away from the bloodshed and support his faltering body.

677 Hector wildly ran amok and terrified the enemy's lines with his violent sting.

679 The Danaans were thrown into confusion by the deaths of their men and turned back. The troops swiftly fled to their camp and reinforced the gates by putting down more oak.

682 But the Phrygians began siege, since the Greeks were trapped within their ramparts. They keep watch on the walls and set them on fire.

684 The rest of the Trojan youth spread themselves out in the fields and indulged in wine to relax their minds from worry.

686 The Greek leaders were so alarmed by their crisis that they could neither eat nor rest. Instead, they miserably lamented their fate.

688 Then, at the behest of Nestor, they sent legates and urged Achilles to lend a hand and aid his miserable countrymen.

690 But the Thetideian hero did not listen to the prayers of the Danaans and did not want any of the king's gifts; not even the proposal to return his beloved Briseis, untouched, stirred him to battle.

694 The legates reported back his annoyed response to the Pelasgan leaders. Then, they renewed their strength by eating and finding gentle sleep.

# A midnight mission

696 The shadows of another day slowly passed under the gliding stars as the third part of that silent night continued. The Aetolian hero, by order of the Greeks, departed from camp and chose Ulysses to accompany him to search and study in the dim shadows of the night how confident the Trojans were, what drove them, and how many forces were prepared for battle.

703 And while they made their frightening journey through places that were especially scary at night, a man named Dolon appeared. Since he was a wise man, he had been sent by the Trojan youth to observe the Danaan strength and report back the feelings of both the leaders and the common soldiers.

707 When Ulysses, Diomedes' companion, saw him from far off, they hid and steathily concealed themselves behind some dense shrubs. Then, still hopeful in his vain journey, the Trojan Eumediades ran right before their hiding place. Diomedes hoped to overwhelm him and keep him from easily retreating to his camp.

712 As Dolon ran past them, trusting his courage and strength, Diomedes and Ulysses jumped out and grabbed the young Dolon. He tried to run away and escape but they held onto him threatened him with their swords.

715 He was thoroughly frightened and said: "please, spare me my life. That one thing is enough."

716 But if you persist in your anger, what reward will you get from my death?

718 But if want to know why I have come here during silent night: great Troy has promised to give me Achilles' chariot if we are able to take your treasures.

720 I followed this promise and unlucky fell into this unfortunate situation in which you now see me.

722 Now I implore you by the powerful gods, by the sea, by the waves of dark Dis, not to take my life and cruelly murder me.

725 You will receive these gifts for letting me go safely: I will explain to you king Priam's plans and the possessions of the Phrygians."

727 After that, Diomedes and Ulysses learned of what the Trojans were preparing to do. They then drew their swords and cut the young man's throat.

729 They went into Rhesus's tent and killed him while he was buried in sleep and wine, then robbed his body and killed his allies laying in the field.

732 After the sorrowful deed was done, they loaded the spoils on their backs and took some of the Thracian horses, which were sleek and beautiful beasts. These horses surpassed even Eurus in speed and could not be caught by any flying arrow. @(how to add these adjectives)

736 Then they returned to the Argive fleet at first light. Old Nestor received them at the gates and brought them inside.

738 When they were back inside their camp, they reported what happened to the king.

739 He praised the Pelopeian hero and they allowed their tired limbs to find sweet sleep.

# The battle continues anew

741 First light sent the men back into their old war and the Dardanian and Danaan leaders restored the zeal for battle in the rested soldiers.

743 A cloud of spears rained on both sides and the sound of iron on iron filled the air in the muddled chaos.

745 The disorderly lines approached each other and a river of sweat and blood flowed.

747 Finally, the Danaan king became embroiled in his burning anger and shed the blood of Antiphon, who was knocked to the ground by his gaping wound. He then likewise killed Pisandrus and his brother, Hippolochus, who was running to the fight as well; sword in hand, he approached Iphidamas after that.

751 He struck the king's hand with his spear; he became more enraged from the wound and pursued the fleeing son of Antenor, savagely getting vengeance for his injury.

754 Hector, the son of Priam, then entered the battle. He was provoked by his bitter anger to drive back and strike the Greek soldiers in all directions.

756 Nor did Paris refrain from striking down the enemy troops, as he shot an arrow which wounded Eurypylus's leg.

# The Trojans corner the Greeks

758 The Trojans pressed on as the Pelasgi fled to their camp since their forces were exhausted. They shored up the wall using huge beams.

760 Then Mars-like Hector hurled a rock, which broke through the gates and loosened the iron-enforced walls.

762 The Phrygians rushed through the opening and slew the Greeks standing near the threshold. They then struck down the troops on the rampart while others placed ladders on the walls and hurled torches.

765 Victory increased their strength.

766 The Danaans fought on the walls and tall towers.

767 They threw rocks, but the Trojans made a *testudo* so that they could safely climb to the entrance and threaten the gate by force.

769 All the Pelasgi were thrown into chaos and fled the camp, instead clambering into their ships.

770 The Trojan youth bore down on them and constantly hurled spears.

771 Their shouts filled the air.

772 Neptune gave the Danaans strength and hardened their resolve.

773 A huge fight broke out.

773 The enemy ran rampant all over the place.

774 Asius fell by the hand of Idomeneus; Hector killed fierce Amphimachus, and Alcathous, Anchises' son-in-law, also met his end, slain by the sword of the noble leader Rhytieus.

777 Then fiery Deiphobus struck Ascalaphus with his spear and he drowned in the sea.

779 Hector felt rage in his heart and fought ferociously across the battle. Great Ajax threw a massive rock which struck him and knocked him to the ground.

782 The Trojan soldiers ran to him and soaked the young man's wounds in the Xanthus river while he vomited blood. @(does he vomit into the river or do they soak him in the river)

784 Then they returned again to the fight; there is a great amount of bloodshed on both sides and the ground ran red with blood.

786 Polydamas powerfully struck down Prothoenor, Telamonian Ajax killed Archelochus Antenorides, and Acamas felled Promachus the Boeotian, but in turn was laid low by the hand of savage Peneleus.

789 The Priamian soldiers fell back, but then came back stronger and redoubled their efforts in the war with the Achaeans, forcing the Pelopeian soldiers to flee.

792 Driven by fear, some of the men leapt over the wall and the ramparts that were protected by the moat. Others rolled into the trenches to flee from the battle. @(should I add the to avoid the fight part)

# Hector tries to set fire to the Greek fleet

794 Meanwhile, unwearied Hector, the dread of the Danaans, dashed toward the fight.

795 Agamemnon's troops again fled to the fleet and there began to drive off the enemy with all their might.

797 The fight broke out right in front of the ships.

797 Mars-like Hector ran amok and asked for torches, preparing to set the whole fleet on fire.

799 Ajax resisted him with all his strength. He stood on the nearest ship and used his shield to hold back the raging flames, singlehandedly defending a thousand ships.

802 On one side, the Danaans hurled hard-tipped spears, while on the other side the Phrygians threw fiery torches everywhere; sweat flowed down the fighters' huge bodies.

# Patroclus' deception

805 Patroclus could not bear to watch any longer as his friends were killed. He suddenly emerged on the field wearing Achilles' armor, thoroughly terrifying the Trojans in his false appearance.

808 Those who had just been throwing the Danaans into confusion and fiercely fighting now felt fear in their hearts and fled; bold Patroclus pursued those who were fleeing and created chaos in their ranks. He shed the blood of men across the huge army and greatly wounded Sarpedon. In his fury he passed by several men @(is this really what it means? what is cursu doing) and turned the tide of battle under the terrifying guise of Achilles.

814 When hot-blooded Hector spotted him slaughtering his allied troops and running amok in their ranks. Looking monstrous in his great armor, Hector drew on his courage and fiercely ran to meet him. He loudly rebuked him, saying: "Come this way, turn your course to me, bravest Achilles!"

819 Now you will know what Troy's vengeful right hand is capable of and how strong bravest Hector is in war.

821 Although Mars himself protects you with his arms, nevertheless I will destroy you with my own hand despite him."

823 Patroclus was silent and ignored the threats and strong words to continue his deceit as the man whom he was pretending to be. @(Too loose? credatur. Literal is so that he might be believed as the true Achilles, whom he faked.)

825 Then the Dardanian attacked first and hurled a spear with all his strength, but it fell to the ground. Patroclus swiftly removed it and threw it back, along with another gift: he hurled an unnaturally large rock, which struck Hector's shield and settled on the green grass.

829 Then they drew their swords and embroiled themselves in hand to hand combat until Trojan Apollo revealed the lying face of the fake Achilles and exposed him. When the great warrior Hector caught on to the fact that Patroclus was fighting in false arms, he charged at him, pierced his chest with his naked sword @(naked go with chest or sword), and stripped off his Vulcan arms as the victor.

836 Telamonian Ajax grabbed his dead body and protected it with his shield.

837 The Priamian soldiers happily rejoiced while the Danaans mourned their losses.

# Achilles hears of Patroclus' death

839 Meanwhile, young Nestorides and his sad companions carried the wretched corpse into camp.

841 Then, as the horrible news reached Pelides' hears, he became upset and grew pale as all his warmth left his body; while he was crying, Aeacides tied his mother's mantle to Patroclus and mourned his comrade's sorrowful death.

845 He scratched at his face and dirtied his beautiful hair in the dust. He tore his clothes from his chest and lay on top of his dead friend while he poured forth bitter laments and kissed his body.

849 When his groaning and tears subsided, he said: "you will not be able to celebrate my friend's death without retribution, Hector. You are a boisterous man and will pay a steep price for my grief. You will die in those arms of yours in which you currently boast your victory and your blood will flow in the ground."

# Achilles receives new armor

854 After this, inflamed by his wrath, he ran to the shore and begged Thetis for some strong armaments.

855 She left the sea and immediately begged Vulcan for help.

857 Vulcan Mulciber ignited the fires of Aetna in the hot furnaces and formed the tawny gold with his mighty hammer. @(too loose? do blows for ictibus?)

858 Then he brought back the finished armor, which had been made with his divine expertise, and gave it to Thetis; great Achilles put on the armor and turned his cruel face to look at the shield.

862 On it, the god of fire had engraved the sky and stars and had made the lands of the Ocean, surrounded everywhere by the watery nymphs, and the marvelous sea castles of the Nereids along with Nereus. He also carved the changing stars and laid out the different times of night, along with the four parts of the world. He showed how far the north was from the south and how far away the red sun sets from where it rises. He laid out where Lucifer and Hesperus, both names for the same star, rose in the sky with their horses. He showed how far the concave moon traveled in its orbit @(too modern?) and where it lit up the sky as its shining lamp; he also included the seas along with their gods: great Nereus and old Oceanus and fickle Proteus, as well as the wild Tritones and Doris, the lover of the tide; he also displayed the watery Nereids with marvelous artistry.

875 The land had forests and horrifying wild monsters and rivers and mountains and towns with high walls in which people debate and enforce their laws and old codes; a judge that was fair to each side sat and heard cases in a calm state of mind.

880 On another part, chaste girls sang Paeans and gave a beautiful performance while a hand beat a drum; Apollo strummed simple chords on his lyre with his thumb and played the seven modes on the reeds: they composed songs that reproduced the motion of the world.

885 Other people tilled the fields, young bulls plowed the arable land @(gravia is the issue). A strong harvester reaped the matured grains and a dirty vineyard worker was glad that his grapes were finally pressed.

888 Herds grazed through the meadows and goats laid on a cliffside.

889 In the middle of the shield stood Mars, shining in his gilded armor. The goddess Atropus sat around him, along with the others, Clotho and Lachesis, who looked grim because of their snaky hair.
