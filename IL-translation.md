# Preface

1   Goddess, tell me about Pelides' arrogant wrath, which wrought sorrowful deaths on the wretched Greeks and sent the brave souls of heroes down to Orcus: the wrath that allowed dogs and birds to tear at the heroes' bloodless limbs and unburied bones.

6   The highest king agreed that the conflict had first been incited by the warring hearts of sceptered Atrides and Achilles, renowned in battle.

9   Which god forced these men to struggle in such sorrowful wrath?

10  It was the child of Leto and powerful Jupiter.

10  He sent into the Pelasgian king's heart a horrible plague, which likewise afflicted the Danaans.

13  One day, Chryses, wearing his sacred band on his brow, wept and mourned the fact that his daughter had been taken from him. He spent his days and nights in a state of hatred and his constant wailing filled the air.

17  Because not a single day lifted this weight from him and his wailing did not allay his tears for his daughter, he sought the Danaan camp, laid himself at the feet of Atrides, and begged the gods and his wretched head of state to return his daughter, the source of his wellbeing.

22  He also offered gifts.

22  The Myrmidons were overcome by his tears and they thought that Chryseis should be returned to her father.

24  But Atrides disagreed and forced Chryses to depart from his camp, rejecting his *pietas*: a fierce love clung in Atrides heart of hearts. His ruinous lust denied Chryses' prayers.

27 The slighted priest once again sought the temple of Phoebus; in his grief he scratched his dirty face and tore out his hair and struck his wrinkled forehead.

30 When his groans subsided and his tears abated, he addressed the sacred ears of the prophetic god by saying: how does it benefit me to have worshipped you, Delphic god, or to have led a chaste life for so many years?

34 Why did I place the sacred fires on your altar if I, your priest, am scorned by a foreign enemy?

36 See, these are the rewards I've been given in my old age.

37 If I have been an acceptable servant, keep me safe as my protector.

38 If otherwise, if I am paying the penalty for some harsh crime, of which I am ignorant, why does your hand hold back my further punishment?

40 Draw your sacred bow and aim at me.

41 At least a god will be behind my demise.

41 Attack the father, the one who deserves punishment.

42 Why does my daughter pay for my transgressions by enduring a life in my cruel enemy's bed?

44 He plead his case.

44 Moved by his priest's plea, Apollo wrought great sorrow on the Danaans by sending a plague that infected every soldier.

46 The Greeks fell to ruin. There was hardly enough land for all the funeral pyres and tombs and hardly enough air for the fires.

48 After the stars had been seen for the ninth night and the sun shone on the tenth day, illustrious Achilles assembled the Greek chiefs and encouraged Thestorides to reveal the causes of the evil plague.

52 Then Calchas consulted the gods and found the cause of their misfortune as well as the way to end it. He feared the crowd, but with Achilles protection he said this: "Danaans, if we wish to find refuge from this pestilence, we must placate the will of wrathful Phoebus and return chaste Chryseis to her righteous father."

58 He finished speaking.

58 Suddenly, the king became enraged.

59 He hurled bitter insults at Thestorides and called him a liar.

60 Then he rebuked great Achilles, but the unconquerable hero returned in kind.

62 All the others present join the fracas.

62 When the shouting finally ended, the unjust son of Atreus was forced to return his unwilling bride and give Chryseis, untouched, back to her dutiful father along with many other reparations.

65 Ulysses, trusted by all, placed her on his ship and brought her back to her father's care. Then, he again set sail to return to the Danaan fleet.

68 Immediately Phoebus abandoned his grudge.

69 The Greek host, which had nearly been destroyed, blossomed once again.

70 However, Atrides' desire for Chryseis did not fade; he mourned and grieved for his lost love, feeling that he had been cheated.

72 Then, he snatched Briseis from great Achilles and lightened the burden of his love by depriving another of his beloved.

74 But savage Aeacides approached Atrides with his sword drawn and threatened that, if he did not return his prize, which he had fairly won, he would give Atrides a bloody death. Each man prepared himself for a duel.

78 If chaste Pallas had not forced Achilles to withdraw, blind love would have left her cruel mark in the annals of Argive history.

80 Because his threats were ignored, Pelides prayed that his mother, a goddess of the sea, would not allow Plisthenides to go unpunished.

83 Thetis heard her son's prayer and immediately left the sea. She came to the Myrmidon camp and warned him to refrain from any fights or contests; afterwards, she flew through the airs of heaven and carried herself into the golden stars.

87 Then, although her hair was still unkempt @(need to work on how to do this line) she laid herself at the feet of king of heaven: "I come to you as a mother on behalf of her son, begging your divine will, highest father.

89 Avenge me and my son for Atrides' wrongdoing; if you allow him to go unpunished for violating the love of my Achilles, all virtue will die a shameful death, conquered by lust."

93 Jupiter responded: "Cast aside your sorrowful lament, goddess of the great sea, for I will fulfill your undertaking.

95 Console your son's grieving heart."

96 He finished.

96 Thetis glided down through the gentle air of heaven and came to her father's shores and sisters' beloved waves.

However, Juno was offended: "Great husband of mine," she said, "does the daughter of Doris hold so much sway, is so much owed to Achilles, @while for me, who is called your wife and also bears the sweet name of sister, you wish to shed the blood of my beloved Argives and renew the fighting spirit of the Trojans?"
