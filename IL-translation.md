# Preface

@1   Goddess, tell me about the wrath of arrogant Pelides, which wrought sorrowful deaths on the wretched Greeks and sent the brave souls of heroes down to Orcus and left their bloodless limbs and unburied bones for dogs and birds to rip apart.
[superbus transferred? / brought about too weak? / why the reboot at line 4 and allowed? too free here?]

@6   The will of the highest king was abided, since first the warring hearts of sceptered Atrides and the renowned warrior Achilles created their feud.
[ut primum (unusually) = "since first"]

@9   Which god forced these men to struggle in such bitter anger?
[tristi not sorrowful here]

*10  It was the son of Lato[Leto] and powerful Jupiter.

*10  He infected the Pelasgian king's heart with a horrible plague and the Danaans were also embroiled in the grave illness.
[Try again on implicuit / sthg with gravi morbo?]

# [The priest's daughter?]
*13  One day, Chryses, wearing his sacred band wrapped around his head, wept, mourning the loss of his daughter, who had been taken from him. He spent hated days and nights and his constant lamentations filled the air.
["sacred band wrapped around his head" / wept and mourned paratactic? / he is not hateful, the passage of time is / this last bit is good, changing the subject away from an abl of means: but maybe not wailing?]

*17  Because not a single day lessened his grief, and his continual wailing could not allay his tears for his daughter, he sought the Danaan camp, prostrated himself at the feet of Atrides, and begged by the gods, in his misery, that the king's honor compel him to return his daughter, the source of his wellbeing.

22  He also offered gifts.

22  The Myrmidons were overcome by his tears and thought that Chryseis should be returned to her father.

24  But Atrides disagreed and forced Chryses to depart from his camp, rejecting his *pietas*: a fierce love clung in Atrides heart of hearts. His ruinous lust denied Chryses' prayers.

27 The slighted priest once again sought the temple of Phoebus; in his grief, he scratched his dirty face, tore out his hair, and beat his old temples.

30 When his groans subsided and his tears abated, he addressed the sacred ears of the prophetic god: how does it benefit me to have worshipped you, Delphic god, or to have led a chaste life for so many years?

34 Why did I place the sacred fires on your altar if I, your priest, am scorned by a foreign enemy?

36 See, these are the rewards I've been given in my old age.

37 If I have been an acceptable servant, keep me safe as my protector.

38 If otherwise, if I am paying the penalty for some harsh crime, of which I am ignorant, why does your hand refrain from further punishment?

40 Draw your sacred bow and take aim.

41 At least a god will be behind my demise.

41 Attack the father, the one who deserves punishment.

42 Why is my daughter paying for my transgressions? Why is she forced to endure a life in my cruel enemy's bed?

44 He pled his case.

44 Moved by his priest's plea, Apollo wrought great sorrow on the Danaans by sending a plague that infected every soldier.

46 The Greeks fell to ruin. There was hardly enough land for all the funeral pyres and tombs, and hardly enough air for the fires.

48 After the stars had been seen for the ninth night and the sun shone on the tenth day, illustrious Achilles assembled the Greek chiefs and encouraged Thestorides to reveal the causes of the evil plague.

52 Then Calchas consulted the gods and found the cause of their misfortune as well as the way to end it. He feared the crowd, but with Achilles' protection he said this: "Danaans, if we wish to find refuge from this pestilence, we must placate the will of wrathful Phoebus and return chaste Chryseis to her righteous father."

58 He finished speaking.

58 Suddenly, the king became enraged.

59 He hurled bitter insults at Thestorides and called him a liar.

60 Then he rebuked great Achilles, but the unconquerable hero returned his insults.

62 All the others present join the fracas.

62 When the shouting finally subsided, the unjust son of Atreus was forced to return his unwilling bride and give Chryseis, untouched, back to her dutiful father, along with many other reparations.

65 Ulysses, trusted by all, placed her on his ship and brought her back to her father's care. Then, he again set sail to return to the Danaan fleet.

68 Immediately Phoebus abandoned his grudge.

69 The Greek host, which had nearly been destroyed, blossomed once again.

70 However, Atrides' desire for Chryseis did not fade; he mourned and grieved for his lost love, feeling that he had been cheated.

72 Then, he snatched Briseis from great Achilles and lightened the burden of his love by depriving another of his beloved.

74 But savage Aeacides approached Atrides with his sword drawn and threatened that, if he did not return his prize, which he had fairly won, he would give Atrides a bloody death. Each man prepared himself for a duel.

78 If chaste Pallas had not forced Achilles to withdraw, blind love would have left her cruel mark in the annals of Argive history.

80 Because his threats were ignored, Pelides prayed that his mother, a goddess of the sea, would not allow Plisthenides to go unpunished.

83 Thetis heard her son's prayer and immediately left the sea. She came to the Myrmidon camp and warned him to refrain from any fights or contests; afterwards, she flew through heaven and carried herself into the golden stars.

87 Then, with her hair still unkempt, she laid herself at the feet of the king of heaven: "I come to you as a mother on behalf of her son, begging your divine power, highest father.

89 Avenge me and my son for Atrides' wrongdoing; if you allow him to go unpunished for violating the love of my Achilles, all virtue will die a shameful death, conquered by lust."

93 Jupiter responded: "Cast aside your sorrowful lament, goddess of the great sea, for I will fulfill your undertaking.

95 Console your son's grieving heart."

96 He finished.

96 Thetis glided down through the gentle air of heaven and came @to her father's shores and sisters' beloved waves.

98 However, Juno was offended: "Great husband of mine," she said, "does the daughter of Doris hold so much sway, is so much owed to Achilles? @But as for me, whom you call your wife and sweet sister, you wish to shed the blood of my beloved Argives and renew the fighting spirit of the Trojans?"

103 Are these your gifts for me?

103 Is this how much you love me?

104 The angered goddess hurled harsh words at the Thundering god, but in turn she endured the reproach of the king of heaven.

106 Finally, after the god of fire stepped in to settle the dispute, the great father dismissed the council from his hall.

108 Meanwhile, the sun descended from Olympus and the gods and goddesses held a lavish feast to reinvigorate themselves.

110 Then, they headed  their bedrooms and the delightful gift of sleep.

# Somnus's Mission

111 As night fell, the stars were shining throughout the sky as humans and gods alike rested. The omnipotent father called Somnus and said this: "Go, fly through the light winds, gentlest of the gods, and seek the Argive leader's camp on swift wings. And while he is overwhelmed by the weight of your sweet sleep, relay these orders to him: "when tomorrow's day has first brought out the Titan and chased away the night, gather your men for battle and attack the unwary enemy." (Do I need to preserve the indirect command or is imperative okay)

120 Without delay, Somnus departed and flew through the air on his slender wings into Agamemnon's bed.

121 Somnus laid next to him and held his body, which was overwhelmed by gentle sleep.

123 The lightener of worry and burdens said this to him: "king of the Danaans, Son of Atreus, awaken and receive the instructions of the Thundering god, which I bring to you from heaven."

126 When first the Titan emerges from the waves, order your allies to affix their weapons to their strong arms and seek the Ilian fields in rank and file."

129 He uttered these commands and went back through the breezes whence he had just come.

130 Meanwhile, the sky's fiery lantern gave light to the world.

131 Still astonished by these visions, the Pelopeian hero called an assembly of his generals and explained in order the events of his dream.

133 Everyone pledged their allied forces in battle and encouraged their leader.

134 The king praised their brave hearts and gave equal thanks to all of them.

136 Then Thersites, than whom no one uglier had come to Troy, nor any with a more reckless tongue, (could make this more idiomatic, say something like the ugliest man who came to Troy and the most reckless speaker) denied that this war should be continued and encouraged a return to their native shores. Ulysses, of illustrious counsel, chastised him and struck him with his ivory scepter.

141 Then he became truly angry at the proposed alternative.

142 Scarcely did a hand lack a spear as their tumult is lifted to the stars and the intensity of the fight gripped them all.

144 Finally Nestor, wise in his old age, spoke his placid counsel to settle the disturbed crowd. He advised the leaders to recall the response of the oracle when they saw a serpent in a tree in Aulis consume twice four baby birds along with their mother, who weakly tried to defend against it, but became the final corpse after her children. (probably too free)

151 Then the old man said this: "I am warning you and remind you, Achaeans: it was Calchas who said that in the tenth year of our labor, Ilion would fall to the conquering Greek armies."

154 All agree. Nestor's wisdom is praised and the council is dismissed.

155 The leader orders his men to prepare their weapons for battle, along with their minds and bodies.

157 When first light dispelled the silent shadows and Titan raised his head from the waves, showing his shining rays, the harsh son of Atreus ordered his allies to arm themselves and seek the Ilian fields in military order.

# Invocation of the Muses

161 Now Muses - for what is unknown to you? - tell me the names of the famous leaders, their famous lineage and sweet homeland, because these are your gifts.

164 Let us relate how many ships each man led to Pergamum and finish this undertaking. May Apollo be our inspiration and freely aid our work in each line.

# The Catalog of Ships

167 First came (or is this the noun as appositive) Peneleus and the keen warrior Leitus, savage Arcesilaus and Prothoenor and Clonius, the Boeotians, who led fifty ships and coursed through the swelling tides using their strong oarsmen.

171 Then Agamemnon, born of Mycenae's walls, whom warlike Greece chose as their leader, led a hundred ships filled with armed soldiers; and the fiery Menelaus followed with sixty ships, as did Agapenor in his wild rage.

176 Near these men was faithful Nestor, a man of wise sentiment and powerful counsel, along with his twin sons, who brought ninety ships armed for war.

179 Schedius, a man of great virtue, and massive Epistrophus, the glory of the Myrmidons, both bulwarks in the savage war, plowed the tall waves along with forty prows, and Polypoetes and Leonteus led forty ships carrying brave soldiers.

184 The leaders Euryalus and Sthenelus, along with the brave soldier Tydides, cut through the sea with their strong oars; these men loaded eighty ships with soldiers.

187 Powerful Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, both keen men, filled thirty ships with strong oarsmen, and Ajax, the bravest of the Locrians, led twice twenty ships, as did the son of Euhaemon. They were accompanied by Achilles, the wall of the Greeks, sailing fifty ships across his mother's seas.

193 Phidippus and Antiphus, the Thessalonian youth came next, leading thrice ten prows cleaving the deep sea.

195 And Teucer cut through the waves with his three ships, while Tlepolemus the Rhodian took nine. Eumelus, a man of keen strength, followed these men, having set sail with one fewer ship than that of Salaminian Ajax, the son of Telamon.

199 And Prothous the Magnesian, son of Tenthredon, and also Elephenor, born in the great land of Euboea, and Meges the Dulichian, and Thoas, a man of great courage and strength, the son of Andraemon of the Aetolians, altogether led forty ships.

204 And the wise man of Ithaca, Ulysses, led twice six ships, followed by Telamonian Ajax, a man of exceptional courage.

206 With him came Guneus, a man of frightening strength, sailing twice eleven ships.

208 Idomeneus and Meriones, both of Crete, came also, strengthened by forty ships; and Menestheus the Athenian, a man of famed heritage, led as many ships as Achilles could muster.

212 Fierce Amphimachus and Thalpius, born in Elis, and Polyxenus, a man of famed courage, along with Diores, altogether loaded twice twenty ships with soldiers.

215 Protesilaus and brave Podarces drove as many ships as Oileus Ajax led, all fitted for battle; and the son of Poeas brought seven armed ships. Near him followed Podalirius and Machaon, who cut through the wide sea with thrice ten prows.

220 With all these men leading them, the Greeks led fourteen fewer than twelve hundred ships to the shores of Troy.

222 The men quickly put the ships ashore and took to the field when the Saturnian father sent Priam a message from Iris to warn him that the brave Pelasgians had come to wage war.

225 Without delay, Hector Priamides immediately took up arms, as was his father's command, and ordered all the Trojan youth to ready themselves for battle so he could lead them through the city's open gates.

228 A shiny golden helmet covered each side of his youthful head, a breastplate protected his chest and a shield adorned his left side. He wielded a spear in his right hand and a sword hung at his side; also, shining greaves, befitting of Hector, covered his long legs.

233 A more beautiful man followed after him, who was at that time mighty in arms: the cause of the war, Paris, the calamitous ruin of his homeland. Deiphobus and Helenus and brave Polites followed as well, along with sacred Aeneas, most certainly the child of Venus, and Archelochus and savage Acamas, the sons of Antenor; indeed, both Pandarus, the noble descendant of Lycaon, and Glaucus, a man of great courage in battle, came to fight, as did Amphius and Adrastus and Asius and Pylaeus.

240 Amphimachus and Nastes, each great men, also came, with the brave leaders Odius and massive Epistrophus, as did savage Euphemus and Pyraechmes, famous in his time, with whom came Mesthles and Antiphus and the great fighter Hippothous and Acamas and Pirous, together with Chromius and Ennomus, the sons of Arsinous, both of them in their prime, followed by Phorcus and great Ascanius, and also Sarpedon, the renowned offspring of Jupiter, and Coroebus, born in that famed land.

250 Neptunian Troy defended herself with the help of these leaders, and would have foiled the plot of the Greeks, if not for the fates.

# Hector Proposes a Duel

252 And now both battle lines were standing in their resplendent armor, when Paris, the deadly flame and destruction of Troy, saw a fully-armed Menelaus standing in the opposing army. Paris runs back frantically to his allies as if he had seen a snake and was terrified.

256 Hector saw him in his shameless disarray and said: "You, our country's eternal disgrace and our family's dishonor, why are you turning your back on this?"

259 Once, you did not hesitate to violate the bed of a host, whose weapons you are fleeing and force you fear.

261 Where is your courage? Where is your strength that we once knew in different competitions and games?

263 Here is where you show us your character.

263 Your famous beauty will not help you in battle.

264 Mars likes a tough soldier.

265 While you sleep with your love, we must wage war and shed our blood in our enemy's midst.

267 Let unwearied Atrides fight you and match your strength on an equal field as the Danaans and Phrygians watch without any fighting.

269 After a treaty is agreed upon, you must bring your force to bear against him and settle the dispute by the sword."

271 He finished speaking.

271 The Priamian hero said a few words in return: "why do you insult me so undeservingly, brother, pride of my country?"

273 It is untrue that my spouse, my stolen luxury, is greater than the honor of my courage. I do not refuse to test my strength in battle against his, as long as my wife goes to the victor without further bloodshed."

277 Hector reported this conversation; the Greeks agreed with the plan.

# The Duel of Paris and Menelaus

278 Immediately, Priam was summoned to carry out the proper sacrifices and seal the treaties.

279 After that, each group departed, cast aside their weapons, and cleared the field.

281 Meanwhile, beautiful Alexander appeared from the Trojan crowd, easily spotted because of his shield and spear.

283 Menelaus stood against him, gleaming in his armor, and said "Let us begin our fight. You will no longer enjoy the company of my wife, and you will mourn the day you took her, as Jupiter is my witness."

287 As soon as he had finished speaking, the bitter man rushed against his enemy.

288 Paris repelled his approach with a strong blow and took a few quick step in retreat. He then threw a quivering spear from afar, but Atrides avoided it. In turn, he threw a spear which would have pierced the Phrygian thief's body, if not for the seven-fold iron mail which covered his brood chest in the back.

294 There was an outcry all around; then each man stood against the other, as their helmets crashed together, their feet kicked at the other's heels, and their swords whistled and vibrated; both men were protected by their brilliant weapons and armor.

298 They were not unlike strong bulls, who wage war over a pretty mate and, as they fight, their loud mooing fills the air.

300 For a long time they used their rough swords to try to cut the other man. But, when Atrides remembered his stolen bride, he closed in and overwhelmed the Dardanian youth.

302 Paris retreated backwards as Menelaus threatened him from above with his swordplay. However, his splendid sword shattered when he struck the edge of Paris's helmet. The Greeks groaned in dismay.

306 Then Menelaus truly flew into a rage, though his hand lacked a sword, and he knocked the young Paris over and dragged his helmet to his allies, @holding it as if he had won. If Cytherea had not covered Paris in a dark mist and @broken the strong strap on his chin, that would have been Paris's last day.

311 Menelaus dragged the shining golden helmet and angrily threw it to the chiefs. He then again returned to the fight and threw a huge spear with all his strength to finish off the Phrygian, but Venus snatched Paris away from his enemy and brought him into his bed, inlaid with tortoise shell.

317 Then she summoned Helen from the tall walls and led her to her love, Dardanian Paris.

319 When Helen saw him, she said: "Paris, my love, have you come to me a loser in the fight against my former spouse?"

321 I saw it happen and was ashamed to see when violent Atrides took hold of you and dragged you around and soiled your hair in the Ilian dust.

324 Miserable me! I feared that his Doric sword would bring an end to our kisses; my mind was driven insane, all color fled from my face and my blood left my limbs.

327 Who persuaded you to go up against savage Atrides?

328 Or had the widespread fame of his courage in battle not yet reached your ears?

329 I am telling you, you should not wish to entrust your fate to his hand. @(What to do with inique)

331 She said this as large tears flooded her face.

332 Gloomy Alexander replied: "Atrides did not defeat me, O my love, but rather the wrath of chaste Pallas."

334 Soon you will see, he will shamefully succumb to my strength, and Cytherea will aid me in this endeavor.

336 After that, they mutually embraced and he lay with her, the child of the swan; she received his love and that of Troy @(Troiae) with an open bosom

339 Meanwhile, Menelaus looked for Alexander among the Trojans and carried himself as if he had won.

341 His brother helps him while rousing the allied troops for war. He yelled harsh words at the beaten Phrygians, claiming that the conditions of the battle should be observed and Helen should be returned.

344 While the leaders continued to argue amongst themselves, the omnipotent king of Olympus held a council meeting. Then, Pandarus drew his bow and ended the truce, seeking you, Menelaus; the flying arrow cut into his side and cut his reinforced iron tunic.

349 Atrides let out a groan and left the field to go to the safety of the camp. There, the young Podalirius, using the knowledge handed down from his father, healed Menelaus with Paeonian herbs and sent him back to the horrifying and bloody battle.

353 Agamemnon's wrath roused his brave troops for battle as their communal grief compelled them to fight.

355 A great battle arose and much blood was shed on both sides. Bodies were scattered across the whole field as throngs of Trojans and Greeks were killed in turn. There was no rest for the men: Mars' cries could be heard everywhere as showers of spears flew in all directions.

360 Thalysiades was cut down by the harsh sword of Antilochus and plunged into the realm of shadows, leaving the pleasing world of light.

362 Then Telamonian Ajax attacked Anthemion's son, who was pursuing the Greeks from behind with all his strength, and pierced his chest using his hardened spear.

365 The son of Anthemion vomited purple guts mixed with blood and began to cry as he passed away. @(Should this be riget? Like hardened? Or is he crying?)

366 Then Antiphus exerted all the force of his body to hurl a spear at Aeacides; however, the spear wandered from its intended enemy and struck a different one, piercing Leucon's groin.

370 This unlucky man was laid low by the grievous wound and, while he lay dying, he chewed on the green grass.

372 Unwearied Atrides was moved by his friend's death. He attacked Democoon and pierced his temples with his wooden spear. The wild son of Atreus drew his sword from its sheath. Democoon fell to his attacks and as he lay dying on his back, he beat his head against the ground.

377 Then Pirous, the son of Imbrasus, threw a huge rock at Amaryncides, which knocked him down and handed him over to silent death; but while he eagerly tried to plunder the young man's spoils, a spear came from above that was sent by the hand of Thoas. The spear pierced Pirous' shoulders and went straight through his strong chest.

382 He fell on his face as he vomited warm blood and trembled while he lay on top of his weapons.

384 Everywhere the Dardanian fields were wet with blood. The rivers ran red with blood likewise.

385 Both armies raged as they fought in the turmoil. First the courage of the Trojans, then that of the Greeks became greater, as both sides desired sweet victory through any means necessary.
