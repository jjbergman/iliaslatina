# Preface

1   Goddess, tell me about Pelides' arrogant wrath, which wrought sorrowful deaths on the wretched Greeks and sent the brave souls of heroes down to Orcus: the wrath that allowed dogs and birds to tear at the heroes' bloodless limbs and unburied bones.

6   The highest king agreed that the conflict had first been incited by the warring hearts of sceptered Atrides and Achilles, renowned in battle.

9   Which god forced these men to struggle in such sorrowful wrath?

10  It was the child of Lato and powerful Jupiter.

10  He sent into the Pelasgian king's heart a horrible plague, which likewise afflicted the Danaans.

13  One day, Chryses, wearing his sacred band on his brow, wept and mourned the fact that his daughter had been taken from him. He spent his days and nights in a state of hatred and his constant wailing filled the air.

17  Because not a single day lifted this weight from him and his wailing did not allay his tears for his daughter, he sought the Danaan camp, laid himself at the feet of Atrides, and begged the gods and his wretched head of state to return his daughter, the source of his wellbeing.

22  He also offered gifts.

22  The Myrmidons are overcome by his tears and they think that Chryseis should be returned to her father.

24  But Atrides disagrees and forces Chryses to depart from his camp,
rejecting his pietas: a fierce love clung in Atrides heart of hearts. His ruinous lust denied Chryses' prayers.
