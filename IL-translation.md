# Preface

@1   Goddess, tell me about the wrath of arrogant Pelides, which wrought sorrowful deaths on the wretched Greeks and sent the brave souls of heroes down to Orcus and left their bloodless limbs and unburied bones for dogs and birds to rip apart.
[superbus transferred? / brought about too weak? / why the reboot at line 4 and allowed? too free here?]

@6   The will of the highest king was abided, since first the warring hearts of sceptered Atrides and the renowned warrior Achilles created their feud.
[confio = passive of conficio / sententia x= opinion / ut primum (unusually) = "since first" / warrior too bland]

@9   Which god forced these men to struggle in such bitter anger?
[tristi not sorrowful here]

*10  It was the son of Lato[Leto] and powerful Jupiter.

*10  He infected the Pelasgian king's heart with a horrible plague and the Danaans were also embroiled in the grave illness.

# [The priest's daughter?]
*13  One day, Chryses, wearing his sacred band wrapped around his head, wept, mourning the loss of his daughter, who had been taken from him. He spent hated days and nights and his constant lamentations filled the air.
["sacred band wrapped around his head" / wept and mourned paratactic? / he is not hateful, the passage of time is / this last bit is good, changing the subject away from an abl of means: but maybe not wailing?]

*17  Because not a single day lessened his grief, and his continual wailing could not allay his tears for his daughter, he sought the Danaan camp, prostrated himself at the feet of Atrides, and begged by the gods that the miserable king's honor compel him to return his daughter, the source of his wellbeing.

22  He also offered gifts.

22  The Myrmidons were overcome by his tears and thought that Chryseis should be returned to her father.

24  But Atrides disagreed and forced Chryses to depart from his camp, rejecting his *pietas*: a fierce love clung in Atrides heart of hearts. His ruinous lust denied Chryses' prayers.

27 The slighted priest once again sought the temple of Phoebus; in his grief, he scratched his dirty face, tore out his hair, and beat his old temples.

30 When his groans subsided and his tears abated, he addressed the sacred ears of the prophetic god: how does it benefit me to have worshipped you, Delphic god, or to have led a chaste life for so many years?

34 Why did I place the sacred fires on your altar if I, your priest, am scorned by a foreign enemy?

36 See, these are the rewards I've been given in my old age.

37 If I have been an acceptable servant, keep me safe as my protector.

38 If otherwise, if I am paying the penalty for some harsh crime, of which I am ignorant, why does your hand refrain from further punishment?

40 Draw your sacred bow and take aim.

41 At least a god will be behind my demise.

41 Attack the father, the one who deserves punishment.

42 Why does my daughter pay for my transgressions, forced to endure a life in my cruel enemy's bed?

44 He plead his case.

44 Moved by his priest's plea, Apollo wrought great sorrow on the Danaans by sending a plague that infected every soldier.

46 The Greeks fell to ruin. There was hardly enough land for all the funeral pyres and tombs, and hardly enough air for the fires.

48 After the stars had been seen for the ninth night and the sun shone on the tenth day, illustrious Achilles assembled the Greek chiefs and encouraged Thestorides to reveal the causes of the evil plague.

52 Then Calchas consulted the gods and found the cause of their misfortune as well as the way to end it. He feared the crowd, but with Achilles' protection he said this: "Danaans, if we wish to find refuge from this pestilence, we must placate the will of wrathful Phoebus and return chaste Chryseis to her righteous father."

58 He finished speaking.

58 Suddenly, the king became enraged.

59 He hurled bitter insults at Thestorides and called him a liar.

60 Then he rebuked great Achilles, but the unconquerable hero returned his insults.

62 All the others present join the fracas.

62 When the shouting finally subsided, the unjust son of Atreus was forced to return his unwilling bride and give Chryseis, untouched, back to her dutiful father, along with many other reparations.

65 Ulysses, trusted by all, placed her on his ship and brought her back to her father's care. Then, he again set sail to return to the Danaan fleet.

68 Immediately Phoebus abandoned his grudge.

69 The Greek host, which had nearly been destroyed, blossomed once again.

70 However, Atrides' desire for Chryseis did not fade; he mourned and grieved for his lost love, feeling that he had been cheated.

72 Then, he snatched Briseis from great Achilles and lightened the burden of his love by depriving another of his beloved.

74 But savage Aeacides approached Atrides with his sword drawn and threatened that, if he did not return his prize, which he had fairly won, he would give Atrides a bloody death. Each man prepared himself for a duel.

78 If chaste Pallas had not forced Achilles to withdraw, blind love would have left her cruel mark in the annals of Argive history.

80 Because his threats were ignored, Pelides prayed that his mother, a goddess of the sea, would not allow Plisthenides to go unpunished.

83 Thetis heard her son's prayer and immediately left the sea. She came to the Myrmidon camp and warned him to refrain from any fights or contests; afterwards, she flew through heaven and carried herself into the golden stars.

87 Then, with her hair still unkempt, she laid herself at the feet of the king of heaven: "I come to you as a mother on behalf of her son, begging your divine power, highest father.

89 Avenge me and my son for Atrides' wrongdoing; if you allow him to go unpunished for violating the love of my Achilles, all virtue will die a shameful death, conquered by lust."

93 Jupiter responded: "Cast aside your sorrowful lament, goddess of the great sea, for I will fulfill your undertaking.

95 Console your son's grieving heart."

96 He finished.

96 Thetis glided down through the gentle air of heaven and came @to her father's shores and sisters' beloved waves.

98 However, Juno was offended: "Great husband of mine," she said, "does the daughter of Doris hold so much sway, is so much owed to Achilles? @But as for me, whom you call your wife and sweet sister, you wish to shed the blood of my beloved Argives and renew the fighting spirit of the Trojans?"

103 Are these your gifts for me?

103 Is this how much you love me?

104 The angered goddess hurled harsh words at the Thundering god, but in turn she endured the reproach of the king of heaven.

106 Finally, after the god of fire stepped in to settle the dispute, the great father dismissed the council from his hall.

108 Meanwhile, the sun descended from Olympus and the gods and goddesses held a lavish feast to reinvigorate themselves.

110 Then, they sought their bedrooms and the delightful gift of sleep.

# Somnus's Mission

111 As night fell, the stars were shining throughout the sky as humans and gods alike rested. The omnipotent father called Somnus and said this: "Go, fly through the light winds, gentlest of the gods, and seek the Argive leader's camp on swift wings. And while he is overwhelmed by the weight of your sweet sleep, relay these orders to him: "when tomorrow's day has first brought out the Titan and chased away the night, gather your men for battle and attack the unwary enemy." (Do I need to preserve the indirect command or is imperative okay)

120 Without delay, Somnus departed and flew through the air on his slender wings into Agamemnon's bed.

121 Somnus laid next to him and held his body, which was overwhelmed by gentle sleep.

123 The lightener of worry and burdens said this to him: "king of the Danaans, Son of Atreus, awaken and receive the instructions of the Thundering god, which I bring to you from heaven."

126 When first the Titan emerges from the waves, order your allies to affix their weapons to their strong arms and seek the Ilian fields in rank and file."

129 He uttered these commands and went back through the breezes whence he had just come.

130 Meanwhile, the sky's fiery lantern gave light to the world.

131 Still astonished by these visions, the Pelopeian hero called an assembly of his generals and explained in order the events of his dream.

133 Everyone pledged their allied forces in battle and encouraged their leader.

134 The king praised their brave hearts and gave equal thanks to all of them.

136 Then Thersites, than whom no one uglier had come to Troy, nor any with a more reckless tongue, (could make this more idiomatic, say something like the ugliest man who came to Troy and the most reckless speaker) denied that this war should be continued and encouraged a return to their native shores. Ulysses, of illustrious counsel, chastised him and struck him with his ivory scepter.

141 Then he became truly angry at the proposed alternative.

142 Scarcely did a hand lack a spear as their tumult is lifted to the stars and the intensity of the fight gripped them all.

144 Finally Nestor, wise in his old age, spoke his placid counsel to settle the disturbed crowd. He advised the leaders to recall the response of the oracle when they saw a serpent in a tree in Aulis consume twice four baby birds along with their mother, who weakly tried to defend against it, but became the final corpse after her children. (probably too free)

151 Then the old man said this: "I am warning you and remind you, Achaeans: it was Calchas who said that in the tenth year of our labor, Ilion would fall to the conquering Greek armies."

154 All agree. Nestor's wisdom is praised and the council is dismissed.

155 The leader orders his men to prepare their weapons for battle, along with their minds and bodies.

157 When first light dispelled the silent shadows and Titan raised his head from the waves, showing his shining rays, the harsh son of Atreus ordered his allies to arm themselves and seek the Ilian fields in military order.

# Invocation of the Muses

161 Now Muses - for what is unknown to you? - tell me the names of the famous leaders, their famous lineage and sweet homeland, because these are your gifts.

164 Let us relate how many ships each man led to Pergamum and finish this undertaking. May Apollo be our inspiration and freely aid our work in each line.

# The Catalog of Ships

167 First came (or is this the noun as appositive) Peneleus and the keen warrior Leitus, savage Arcesilaus and Prothoenor and Clonius, the Boeotians, who led ten times five ships and coursed through the swelling tides using their strong oarsmen.

171 Then Agamemnon, born of Mycenae's walls, whom warlike Greece chose as their leader, led a hundred ships filled with armed soldiers; and the fiery Menelaus followed with twice thirty ships, as did Agapenor in his wild rage.

176 Near these men was faithful Nestor, a man of wise sentiment and powerful counsel, along with his twin sons, who brought three times thirty ships armed for war.

179 Schedius, a man of great virtue, and massive Epistrophus, the glory of the Myrmidons, both bulwarks in the savage war, plowed the tall waves along with forty prows, and Polypoetes and Leonteus led twice twenty ships carrying brave soldiers.

184 The leaders Euryalus and Sthenelus, along with the brave soldier Tydides, cut through the sea with their strong oars; these men loaded twice forty ships with soldiers.

187 Powerful Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, both keen men, filled thrice ten ships with strong oarsmen, and Ajax, the bravest of the Locrians, led twice twenty ships, as did the son of Euhaemon. They were accompanied by Achilles, the wall of the Greeks, sailing fifty ships across his mother's seas.

193 Phidippus and Antiphus, the Thessalonian youth came next, leading thrice ten prows cleaving the deep sea.

195 And Teucer cut through the waves with his three ships, while Tlepolemus the Rhodian took nine. Eumelus, a man of keen strength, followed these men, having set sail with one fewer ship than that of Salaminian Ajax, the son of Telamon.
